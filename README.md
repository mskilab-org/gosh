# gOSh

A CLI for the nf-gOS pipeline.

## Quickstart
1. `gosh run pipeline` to run the nf-gos pipeline (make sure to provide a samplesheet)
2. `gosh skilift up` to convert the pipeline outputs into something ingestible by the gOS frontend
3. (optional) `gosh run outputs -p [pipeline results directory] -s [samplesheet path]` to generate a csv containing your outputs
